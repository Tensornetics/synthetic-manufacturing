# Synthetic Manufacturing with Tensor-Based Machine Learning

This project provides a machine learning-based approach to synthetic manufacturing, allowing for the prediction and optimization of synthetic reactions. The workflow includes data collection, tensor encoding, model training, prediction, synthesis, and validation. The project uses TensorFlow and XState to manage the machine learning and workflow components, respectively.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Tensornetics/synthetic-manufacturing.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

The project is organized into several subdirectories, each containing the code for a specific step in the synthetic manufacturing process:

- `data-collection`: Collects data on previous synthetic reactions
- `tensor-encoding`: Encodes collected data into a tensor representation
- `model-training`: Trains a machine learning model with the encoded data
- `prediction`: Uses the trained model to predict the outcome of a new reaction
- `synthesis`: Guides the synthesis process based on the predicted outcome
- `validation`: Validates the quality of the synthesized product

Each subdirectory contains a `main.py` file that can be run to execute the corresponding step in the workflow. For example, to run the data collection step:

```bash
cd data-collection/
python main.py
```

The repository also includes a tests/ directory, which contains unit tests for each step of the workflow.
